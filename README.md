# (DEPRECATED) Hotel Booking App

## Overview

This was a part of my module 3 back-end asssesment project. It was also my first React/Node.js full-stack application. Unfortunately, I was unable to salvage the database I've uploaded during that time as all data is wiped. But the features are very much similar from the module 2 front-end assessment project. 

Key difference here is that I've written my own API endpoints for the React application to connect and receive data. 

## Features

1. SQL database for accurate querying
2. Node.js with Express used for web server application
3. React.js for front-end application
4. Seamless deployment via Vercel

~~## Installation~~

~~2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd repository`~~
~~3. Install dependencies: `npm install`~~
~~4. Run project: `npm run dev`~~
